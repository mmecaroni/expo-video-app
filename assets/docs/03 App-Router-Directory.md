## Move Source Code

From `App.tsx` take code and move it to `app/index.tsx`
Rename the `App()` function to `HomeScreen()`.
Test it by refreshing, or clear cache if needed, and make a change to the code.
Then just delete `App.tsx`.

## IF you want `src/app` Directory

Create the `src` directory and move `app/index.tsx` to it.
